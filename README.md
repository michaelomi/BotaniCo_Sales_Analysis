## Part 1: Data Analysis (SQL)
[(Back to Table of Contents)](#table_of_contents)

### üöÄ Highlights
- The first year (2022) recorded the highest revenue and gross profit, totaling $13.5 million and $5.41 million, respectively.
- November 2022 was the month with the highest revenue and gross profit, achieving $1.38 million and $543,000.
- The Large Outdoor plant category had the highest sales and revenue figures.
- **Veronica Prostrata** generated the most revenue, while **Piper Dilatatum** had the highest sales volume.
- Customers from China contributed the most to our revenue, accounting for 33.7% of the total.
- **Labadie Group** leads in customer lifetime value.

üìÖ Seasonality:
- Excluding 2024, as it does not represent a full year of data, November-December rank among the top four months for revenue, while March-April-May are in the top five.

### üîß Technical Analysis:

In this analysis, I utilized Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to create the **BotaniCo_Analysis** database and import datasets for **Accounts**, **Sales**, and **Products**. I performed data cleaning by removing duplicates and handling NULL values, then created a consolidated **Customers** table and transformed the **Sales** table into a **Fact_Sales** table. I calculated key metrics such as **gross profit**, analyzed **sales seasonality**, and segmented customers based on **revenue**. Additionally, I evaluated **customer lifetime value (CLTV)** and retention, while summarizing customer counts by month for 2023.

All SQL queries are [here](https://github.com/michaelomi/BotaniCo_Sales_Analysis/blob/main/BotaniCo_Analysis.sql).

üìä Here is a simple example of an SQL query:

This query retrieves the top five months by total revenue, displaying the year, month, total revenue, and gross profit from the Sales table.

```sql
SELECT TOP 5
    YEAR(Date_Time) Year,
	FORMAT(Date_Time,'MMM') Month,
	SUM(Revenue) AS Total_Revenue,
	SUM(Gross_Profit) as Gross_Profit
FROM 
    Sales
GROUP BY
    YEAR(Date_Time),
	FORMAT(Date_Time,'MMM')
ORDER BY
	Total_Revenue DESC;
```

Result;

|Year   | Month   | Total_Revenue | Gross_Profit  |
|:------|:-------:| :------------:| :------------:|
|2022   | Nov	  | 1383639.02	  | 543093.07     |
|2023	| Apr	  | 1342504.86	  | 531972.38     |
|2023	| Mar	  | 1194088.05	  | 482197.13     |
|2022	| Jan	  | 1193470.25	  | 468952.34     |
|2023	| Nov	  | 1191950.57	  | 499429.63     |

## Part 3: Recommendations & Next Steps
[(Back to Table of Contents)](#table_of_contents)

### üìä Recommendations

1. **Expand High-Performing Product Lines**
   - Focus on the categories that are driving the most revenue, such as **Small Outdoor Plants** and **Veronica Prostrata**.
   - Further investment in **Large Outdoor Plants** can help maintain and grow the revenue generated from this high-performing category.

2. **Enhance Customer Retention**
   - Implement **loyalty programs** targeting the top **10% of customers**. This could involve providing special offers and rewards for repeat purchases, particularly for high-value customers like **Labadie Group**.
   - Investigate the reasons behind the **increase in return rates** in 2023, especially in September, and address the underlying causes to reduce returns and improve retention.

3. **Improve Marketing Efficiency**
   - Optimize marketing campaigns around seasonal trends, especially during **November-December** when revenue peaks.
   - Focus on **March-April-May**, which are in the top five months for revenue, by launching campaigns targeted at customers who are most likely to purchase during these months.
   - Leverage the **top countries** contributing to revenue, particularly **China**, to expand market share through targeted regional campaigns.


### üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Integrate Financial Metrics**
   - Integrate more **financial metrics** like **profit margins** into the analysis to refine recommendations. This will help optimize product pricing, identify cost-effective products, and improve profitability.
   - Use metrics such as **Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)** to assess the long-term impact of customer relationships on overall business growth.

2. **Explore Supply Chain Data**
   - Dive into **supply chain data** to identify areas where cost-saving opportunities exist. Streamlining logistics, reducing stock-outs, and improving supplier relationships could further enhance profitability and operational efficiency.

3. **Monitor Customer Return Behavior**

## üîç Addendum: Data Cleaning Notes
[(Back to Table of Contents)](#table_of_contents)

In preparing the dataset for analysis, several data cleaning steps were performed to ensure accuracy and consistency:

1. **Accounts Table Cleaning**
   - Initially, the **Accounts** table contained **1,745 rows**. After removing **null values** from the primary key, the row count was reduced to **948**.
   - Further cleaning was done by **properly formatting the ID column**, ensuring it was unique for each customer. This reduced the row count to **620**.
   - The **Accounts** table was then **renamed to Customers** in SQL to reflect its role in the analysis as a customer-centric table.

2. **Foreign Keys**
   - The **Sales** table‚Äôs foreign keys were updated to match the newly cleaned **Customers** table, ensuring proper relational integrity across the database.

3. **Product Table**
   - A minor correction was made to the **Product Table**, where the **column header** was updated to ensure clarity and consistency across all tables.

By addressing these data quality issues, the dataset is now structured for accurate and reliable analysis, ensuring the integrity of the insights derived from the Power BI dashboard and SQL queries.
